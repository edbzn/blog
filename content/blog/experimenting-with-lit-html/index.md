The Polymer team at Google work on a [higher abstraction over web components](https://www.polymer-project.org/blog/2018-12-13-lit-html-rc). I use that library from the `0.10.0` version and today I migrated an app to the `1.0.0-rc.1`.

This view library is incredibly light (3kb), intuitive and fast. A lot of people started to use it after the [Polymer Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruql541T7gc) presentation talk.

### Rendering view with lit-html

We use functional programming to create and compose our views. We can formulate our rendering logic with the following : `UI = fn(data)`.

Lit concepts are pretty common for a frontend developer: life-cycle, directive, binding... There is a lot in common with React, but without the JSX and the **virtual-DOM** buzz-word.

To render a template with Lit we use a native functionality of JavaScript (ES6) : the **literal template** which let us interpolate dynamic values :

```javascript
const sayHello = (name) => html`hello ${name}`;
render(sayHello('Giles Jown'), document.body);
// => hello Giles Jown
```

Using the `render` function Lit build and update the DOM when an expression changed. Immutability is required when changing the state, otherwise the _re-rendering_ does not operate.

Lit also comes with its directive concept, which is function that will be executed during the rendering process. This way we can factorize many rendering behaviors.

```javascript
const getUserProfile = (userId) =>
  fetch(`https://my-awesome-api/user/${userId}`).then(
    (resp) => resp.json(),
    (err) => console.error(err)
  );

render(
  until(
    getUserProfile().then((user) => html`Hello ${user.name}`),
    html`Loading data...`
  ),
  document.body
);
```

There are several built-in directives, for example `until` which display a fallback content while the given Promise isn't resolved yet. Lit is also highly extensible, we can built our own directives.

### Building a web component

Now let's see how to use the lit-html rendering logic in a higher building block. With **lit-element** we can embed the template, the style and the JavaScript in a web component. It's just a tiny _wrapper_ around the [native web components](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction).

```typescript
import { css, html, LitElement, property } from 'lit-element';
import { nothing } from 'lit-html';

export default class PageComponent extends LitElement {
  @property({ type: Boolean })
  showNavbar = true;

  static get styles() {
    return css`
      .page-wrapper {
        max-width: 780px;
        margin: 0 auto;
      }
    `;
  }

  render() {
    return html`
      ${this.showNavbar ? html`<ez-navbar></ez-navbar>` : nothing}
      <main class="page-wrapper"><slot></slot></main>
      <ez-footer></ez-footer>
    `;
  }
}

customElements.define('ez-page', PageComponent);
```

Lit-element works well with TypeScript, just as Angular it relies on annotations to declare component properties. Now I can display our components using the `render` function :

```javascript
render(
  html`
    <ez-navbar></ez-navbar>
    <ez-profile></ez-profile>
    <ez-page .show-navbar="${false}">
      <ez-article-feed></ez-article-feed>
      <ez-twitter-feed></ez-twitter-feed>
      <ez-github-feed></ez-github-feed>
    </ez-page>
  `,
  document.body
);
```

Or directly in the HTML document :

```html
<body>
  <ez-navbar></ez-navbar>
  <ez-page>
    <ez-article-feed></ez-article-feed>
    <ez-twitter-feed></ez-twitter-feed>
    <ez-github-feed></ez-github-feed>
  </ez-page>
  <script src="bundle.js"></script>
</body>
```

Like every SPA components will be rendered only when the `bundle.js` file will be parsed and executed by the browser.

### What differences with the rest of the market?

Lit offers a nice alternative to the classic Angular, Vue and React with some different ideas. Lit Element relies on native web components, which is the only one to do this today. **Web components come with a bunch of pros and cons**, it's up to you to decide when it's appropriate or not. 

Lit is fresh, it uses modern JavaScript to run extremely fast in the browser while keeping our bundle light.

However I do not recommend using lit for any use cases. You will need to compose with a bunch of others libraries (HTTP client, routing...) to build a real-world SPA, which leads in high maintenance costs. 

Also we take the risk to build our app in a non-conventional way since we can stick with every library.

For me the biggest downside is the Server Side Rendering incompatibility which exclude using lit for any SEO oriented apps.
